# Better Gauntlets
A Geometry Dash mod made by **[Dasshu](user:1975253)**

---

Gauntlets as they are don't get the love they deserve. *Let's change that.*

## Mod Overview
This is my very first mod! <c-FF6969>*we dont talk about the other one.</c>*

Have you ever thought the Gauntlets looked <cr>bland and boring</c>? They have unique and creative themes circled around them, yet they all look so <c-808080>dull</c>! This mod aims to bring life to the Gauntlets with custom colors, fonts, QoL tweaks, and more, truly a <cs>**Better Gauntlet**</c> experience!

## Features
- <cg>New</c> colored backgrounds!
- <cg>New</c> keybinds! <cj>(Windows only)</c>
- <cg>New</c> header text for <cj>GauntletSelectLayer</c>
- <cy>Reworked</c> header fonts!

- <co>Overhauled</c> Gauntlet Layout with new visuals!
    - Particles
    - Custom Graphics
    - Menu Details
