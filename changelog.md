## <cg>v1.1.1</c> <cy>(12/20/2024)</c>
- Fixed a crash on Android when entering `GauntletSelectLayer`. Thank you so much, [Jasmine](user:7466002)!!
- Fixed overlapping textures when using GDUtils' "New gauntlets design" setting
- Changed the particles in `GauntletSelectLayer` to add atmosphere to the space
- Darkened the background to add to the atmosphere
- Changed the opacity of the floor texture from 255 -> 128
- Updated the <c-0050cc>Time Gauntlet</c>'s background (07 -> 17)
- Added particles around the stars of completed Gauntlet levels
- Added a new setting: "Update Discord Sprite"
- Added all background changes to the UI, meaning all extra stuff will load even if the gauntlets themselves don't

## <cg>v1.0.0</c> <cy>(12/12/2024)</c>
- Initial release of <cs>**Better Gauntlets**</c>
