Better Gauntlets To-Do:

Main To-Do:
- Replace "The Lost Gauntlets" texture with GR_OxygeneFont and shaders
    - Disable the original "The Lost Gauntlets" title
    - "The" <- smaller text [x]
    - "Lost Gauntlets" <- bigger text [x]
- Add menu particles
    - Possibilities:
        - Ash
        - Dust
        - Clouds/Mist
- Add menu decorations
    - Floor [x]
    - Chains [x]
    - Torches
    - Flickering light
- Settings To-Do:
    - Fully implement "Update Backgrounds" setting
        - vanilla background visibility false [x]
        - add particles
        - recolor everything (kill me)

Done:
- Set star-label color on level completion
- Separate Gauntlet customizations into their own separate files (decluttering main.cpp)
- Check "Level Reposition" setting for gauntlet-shadow, set visibility to false for ALL LEVELS
- Loop Island and Island contents (star-label, gauntlet-level, etc.) IDs for each Gauntlet
- Settings
    - Change Gauntlet sprite based on "Level Reposition" setting status
- Properly center gauntlets
